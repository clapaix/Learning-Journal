# Incessant prattling on Markdown
  Musings of Colette Lapaix on the topic of Github's markdown.
  
## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a simple, lightweight, intuitive plain text markup language. It's syntax is easy to grasp and newcomer friendly. Github utilizes this tool in conjuction with it's Jekyll tool to generate HTML or Hypertext Markup Language pages with design elements while empowering users with the flexibiltiy and freedom to creatively explore the rich and expertly curated sandbox they've given to the public for free.

### _Why choose Markdown?_
Let us list the pros and cons. 

Pros: | Cons:
|------|-------|
| Simple and lightweight. | Less in-depth.|
| Easy to get into. | Not originally written for documentation.|
| Plethora of online tutorials. |  Less creative freedom than CSS/HTML/JS pages.|
| Easy to read syntax. | Merges semantic meaning.|
| Platform-Agnostic. |  Not all forms of Markdown are compatible.|

Markdown remains a very popular medium for coding despite it's limitations, the biggest drawback being that it is not always rendered in browser exactly the same. For larger productions (corporate contracts, large businesses, a need for many precise pages) Markdown starts to lose viability, but for the average joe like you and I it can be incredible. 

Take for instance the simple headers I have above this. With a simple keystroke and a pound sign followed be a space like so ``` ### ``` 
### Anything can be a header!
The table and cells up there are just a simple combination of ``` ---- and |```
Looking at the code in markdown it is easy to see how things are done and emulate it.
This is the biggest strength of Markdown in my opinion. The incredibly easy to decipher syntax makes for easy learning and easy coding. All in all, it's a wonderfully designed tool.
