# Incessant prattling on Markdown
  Musings of Colette Lapaix on the topic of Github's markdown.
  
## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a simple, lightweight, intuitive plain text markup language. It's syntax is easy to grasp and newcomer friendly. Github utilizes this tool in conjuction with it's Jekyll tool to generate HTML or Hypertext Markup Language pages with design elements while empowering users with the flexibiltiy and freedom to creatively explore the rich and expertly curated sandbox they've given to the public for free.

### _Why choose Markdown?_
Let us list the pros and cons. 

Pros:  |  Cons:
|------|-------|
|Simple and lightweight. | Less in-depth.|
|Easy to get into. | Not originally written for documentation.|
|Plethora of online tutorials. |  Less creative freedom than CSS/HTML/JS pages.|
|Easy to read syntax. | Merges semantic meaning.|
|Platform-Agnostic. |  Not all forms of Markdown are compatible.|

Markdown remains a very popular medium for coding despite it's limitations, the biggest drawback being that it is not always rendered in browser exactly the same. For larger productions (corporate contracts, large businesses, a need for many precise pages) Markdown starts to lose viability, but for the average joe like you and I it can be incredible. 

Take for instance the simple headers I have above this. With a simple keystroke and a pound sign followed be a space like so ``` ### ``` 
### Anything can be a header!
The table and cells up there are just a simple combination of ``` ---- and |```
Looking at the code in markdown it is easy to see how things are done and emulate it.
This is the biggest strength of Markdown in my opinion. The incredibly easy to decipher syntax makes for easy learning and easy coding. All in all, it's a wonderfully designed tool.

#Incessant Prattling on Console Commands
This section will be more bullet notes for my own memory's sake as I'm horrid at remembering important commands and the like. 

- LS= List. This shows you everything inside of the directory you're currently inside of.
- CD= The magical school bus of commands, this is gonna take you to some weird places inside of the console command center. This takes you over to the destintation directory you've established. 
    - You cannot leave unattended spaces as they signify separate entities within the console. Be careful not to type something like "Holiday photos" without the appropriate modifiers to show that the space is nomenclature and not a break in command.
- PWD= Print Working Directory. This shows where you are at in the moment. Did you just ls at the wrong time and get a huge list? Don't wanna scroll to see where the hell you are? pwd is your friend.
