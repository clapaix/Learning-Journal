# Notes on Terminal Commands
A collection of bullet notes describing common commands.

- LS= List. This shows you everything inside of the directory you're currently inside of.
- CD= The magical school bus of commands, this is gonna take you to some weird places inside of the terminal center. This takes you over to the destintation directory you've established. 
    - You cannot leave unattended spaces as they signify separate entities within the terminal. Be careful not to type something like "Holiday photos" without the appropriate modifiers to show that the space is nomenclature and not a break in command.
- PWD= Print Working Directory. This shows where you are at in the moment. Did you just ls at the wrong time and get a huge list? Don't wanna scroll to see where the hell you are? pwd is your friend.
- CD ..= back that bus up, but only 1 directory
- LS -L= Show me all the things in the current directory
- LS -A= Show me all the hidden things too.
