# Brief Notes on css
CSS can be broken down in a few simple terms. You have a selector, which denotes what part of the HTML CSS needs to look at, and you have the declaration, which gives CSS a command to alter the presentation of the selector you've chosen. From their you select a certain style property and assign it a value. An example of the above would go as follows. 
```body{
    font-family: arial;
    color: red;}```

This tells css that everything in the body needs to be in arial font, and have the color red.

CSS also manages things like Position, margin, border, padding, layout-- it really handles all of the visuals whereas HTML more or less takes care of the framework. If HTML is the skeleton, Javascript is the muscles and CSS is the skin, hair, and nails. It's pretty, yes, but it's also pretty important to have.
